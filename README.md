## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Rashmi Dhamija, and I obtained my Ph.D. in experimental high-energy physics at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad, India, in collaboration with the Belle experiment at KEK, Japan. 

In the future, I want to apply the skills acquired during my Ph.D to real-world applications in healthcare sector.

**About** 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for research opportunities within a group focusing on radiation therapy, image-guided radiation therapy, and particle therapy.
- ðŸ”­ I've 5+ years of experience in physics analysis, which involves computing in Python, C++, MC simulation, data optimization, data visualization, machine learning, likelihood-based parametric estimation, statistical modeling, data calibration, and error calculation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the calibration of radiation therapy equipment, implementation of quality assurance (QA) protocols, conducting patient-specific QA, formulating treatment plans for various radiotherapy modalities, and performing radiation dosimetry at PGIMER, Chandigarh.
