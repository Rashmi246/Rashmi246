## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rashmi Dhamija. I obtained my Ph.D. in experimental high-energy physics at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad, India, in collaboration with the Belle experiment at KEK, Japan. I am currently working as a Project Scientist at National Brain Research Centre (NBRC), Manesar, Gurugram, Haryana, India.

With over five years of experience working on large-scale data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning algorithms, I am passionate about leveraging my Ph.D. and comprehensive skill set to solve real-world challenges and make a significant impact.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have strong problem-solving abilities, adaptability, and a collaborative approach, honed through years of working with diverse teams on complex projects. I am always enthusiastic about exploring new opportunities that drive industry advancement, particularly in healthcare or finance, where I can contribute to meaningful initiatives.
