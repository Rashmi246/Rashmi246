## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Rashmi Dhamija, and I obtained my Ph.D. in experimental high-energy physics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India, in collaboration with the Belle experiment at KEK, Japan. In the future, I want to apply the skills acquired during my Ph.D to real-world applications in medicine (radiation oncology, medical imaging, or nuclear medicine).
